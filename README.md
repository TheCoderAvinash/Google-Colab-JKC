# Google-Colab
 Colab is a hosted Jupyter Notebook service that requires no setup to use and provides free access to computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs.

# Usage
Click on the assignment, you will find the complete code there. If you want to run it in your own account, there's a `Open in Colab` option at the top of every file. When clicked, you will be redirected to Google Colab with that notebook file.
